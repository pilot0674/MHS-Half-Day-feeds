# MHS-Half-Day-feeds
This is the feeds for the half day routes for Medford High School. Routes are 95, 101 and 134.

These feeds are made by a student at the Medford High School to
organize the half day trips so student at MHS will be worry free
when it comes to getting home safetly from Medford High after
a long day of work, especally after finals! This is a work in
progress and dates WILL change as new school years begin. We
will update the dates as the school years start. 

Thank you
